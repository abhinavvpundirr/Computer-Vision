# Computer-Vision



This repo contains all the computer vision codes I worked on in my Masters.There are some filters that I have implemented without Computer vision libraries using mathematical formulas and numPy. I have also implemented a convolutional neural network with 4 convolutional 2Dlayers on MNIST dataset using Tenserflow and NumPy and compared the accuracy of this model with a  model having no convolutional layers on the same dataset.  

Accuracy of convoulitonal networks:-
                    * with convolutional layers -> 99.26%
                    * without convolutional layers -> 99.75%
