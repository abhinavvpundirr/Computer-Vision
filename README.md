# Computer-Vision



This repo contains some filters that I have implemented without Computer vision libraries using mathematical formulas and numPy. I have also implemented a convolutional neural network with 4 convolutional 2Dlayers on MNIST dataset using Tenserflow and NumPy and compared the accuracy of this model with a Feed Forward Network model on the same dataset.  

Accuracy of convoulitonal networks:-
                    * Convolutional neural network Model -> 99.26%
                    * Feed Forward Network model-> 99.75%
